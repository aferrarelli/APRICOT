The 6 degrees of freedom nonlinear aircraft dynamics can be simulated with a preferred degree of accuracy, meaning that aerodynamic coefficients, stability derivatives [1], actuators and sensor dynamics, disturbances in measurements, wind gusts, control limits and other characteristics can be en- abled separately and with different models by simply changing MATLAB func- tions. The International Standard Atmosphere model [2] is implemented. The whole system is organized so that it is highly usable and configurable, in that any detail of the simulation can be easily changed.\r\nThe possibility to visualize the simulation in a detailed 3D environment is obtained thanks to an interface with the open-source flight simulator Flight- Gear [3], [4], [5], and both the toolbox and the flight simulator support multiple platforms (MacOS, Linux, Windows). Also, different aircraft models can be eas- ily loaded from various sources like XML files, DATCOM files and even custom formats.\r\nWe implemented a manual input interface that allows the user to use an external gamepad to control the aircraft on-line during the simulation, in or- der to validate the effectiveness of the implemented control laws from a pilot perspective.\r\nOn the control side, various classical and modern control techniques [6], [7], [8] are already implemented for the control of longitudinal and lateral dynamics. With respect to existing simulation environments, here multiple controllers can run simultaneously so that a detailed behavior can be reproduced. For linear controllers, that are designed based on decoupled dynamics in specific trim con- ditions, control laws have been implemented and tested in order to provide a simulation far from the operation point where the controllers have been de- signed, and performance assessment can be conducted in order to analyze pos- sible interactions due the the full nonlinear dynamics of the model. Among the implemented control laws, there are pole-placement techniques, LQR/LQG tech- niques [9], LPV and Lyapunov based techniques. An optimization based planning framework is included in order to obtain feed-forward control laws that might consider states and actuators limits and can be used jointly with feedback con- trollers to track a desired path. In such planning framework, advanced features are included like variable mass due to fuel consumption and via-point tracking in the 6D environment.\r\nTests have been conducted with a Boeing 747 aircraft model, see Figure 1.\r\nThe resulting system illustrated in Figure 2 is distributed as a MATLAB Toolbox and is appealing for aerospace designers and didactic purposes. With respect to similar commercial platforms, see [10], [11], [12], this toolbox is dis- tributed as open-source software, hence users can modify any detail and con- tribute with aircraft models, physical functions, and advanced control laws.\r\nKey words: Aircraft control design, Aircraft dynamics simulation, Linear and nonlinear control\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1.
